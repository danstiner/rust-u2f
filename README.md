This program is basically complete, I am not currently planning to add new features like passwordless login the newer [FIDO2 standard](https://fidoalliance.org/specifications/) supports.

## Security

Disclaimer: This is a personal project, I am not a security expert and make no guarantee of security.

Like any U2F authenticator this program provides a degree of protection against phishing and poorly chosen passwords. It does **not** provide the same level of protection against malware that a hardware authenticator does.

If your machine is compromised by malware, the attacker could steal a copy of the secret keys stored by this authenticator. In this situation you should immediately unregister this authenticator anywhere it is registered in addition to changing the passwords of any potentially compromised accounts. With a hardware authenticator secret keys never leave the device, so in the case of malware you can simply unplug from the infected machine and be confident your accounts are safe from further compromise.

## Installation

After installing, test your new virtual U2F device on a site supporting it such as: https://demo.yubico.com/webauthn-technical/registration

### Arch

Install the AUR package maintained by [@grawity](https://github.com/grawity): https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/softu2f/

Then enable and start the installed services:
```bash
systemctl --system enable --now softu2f.socket
systemctl --user   enable --now softu2f.service
```

### Fedora

```bash
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/danstiner/softu2f/script.rpm.sh | sudo bash
sudo dnf install softu2f
systemctl --user start softu2f
```

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install -y curl
curl -s https://packagecloud.io/install/repositories/danstiner/softu2f/script.deb.sh | sudo bash
sudo apt install -y softu2f
systemctl --user start softu2f
```

## Building

See `Dockerfile.debian` or `Dockerfile.fedora` for pre-requisite packages that must be installed.

Then run `cd linux && make`.

To install run `cd linux && make install`. The install target uses sudo so you will be prompted for your password.

### Bump version

* Run `bumpversion --no-tag patch`
* Update `linux/meta-package/debian/changelog` and amend the commit
* Push and manually tag the release
* Package for all platforms and upload package files
